What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When we initialize a repository, a folder is created with name 'git' and 
	it contains all the metadata needed to track the history of the repo.
	This directory will be hidden. We need to initialize the repository because
	without initializing it, we can not track the versions of files. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Working directory may contain lot of files. we may want to track only few files out 
	all the files in the working directory. That's when the staging area comes into picture.
	Staging area helps us track the files and commit specific files only.
