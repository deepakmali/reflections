What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When we initialize a repository, a folder is created with name 'git' and 
	it contains all the metadata needed to track the history of the repo.
	This directory will be hidden. We need to initialize the repository because
	without initializing it, we can not track the versions of files. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Working directory may contain lot of files. we may want to track only few files out 
	all the files in the working directory. That's when the staging area comes into picture.
	Staging area helps us track the files and commit specific files only.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I can check with git diff to see if a logical change is done and commit only 
	after a logical change is done in a file.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Branches will be helpful when I don't want to mess with existing working code but want to test a new experimental
	feature and want to make the same application for different language and want to keep the existing app
	intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Diagrmas will help us to know which commit is linked to what. It will help us get the history of a branch and 
	what commits are reachable and what commits are not.
