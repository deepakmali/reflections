When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	If we have a remote repository we can access it from any computer,device 
	connected to internet. But if we have it on local we will have to carry 
	our laptop wherever we go. And if code is also in remote it will be helpful
	when we lose our laptop, hard disk failure, accidental delete etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It is good that we pull the changes manually because when multiple coders 
	are working together on a project and push their changes to remote , we may not
	want their changes in out local code. Hence manual syncing is better that autmatically
	syncing.
